# Hi! I'm Wen 👋
## 🎓 Junior at California State University, California, studying Computer Science
I'm passionate about Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, and I'm eager to continue learning and growing in this exciting field. Most of my experience so far comes from school projects, but I'm actively working on building more personal projects to deepen my understanding.

Currently, I'm a Break Through Tech AI Fellow, where I learn about machine learning and build models through hands-on experience. I'm looking to leverage and expand my skills by contributing to meaningful projects and learning from industry professionals.

## 👩‍💻 Projects:
A few projects I've worked on:

**1. Book Review - ML Model**

I built a sentiment analysis model to classify book reviews as either positive or negative, using the review text as the main feature. This binary classification problem helps determine the overall tone of customer feedback. The model can add value for companies by identifying which books are well-received, enabling better recommendation systems. For example, books with positive reviews can be promoted to more users, while readers who leave favorable feedback can be recommended similar titles or other works by the same author. This approach supports personalized marketing, improves user engagement, and provides insights into customer preferences.

* **Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Matplotlib, Keras
* **Learnings:** Uses neural networks to train the data

**2. Leftover Food Tracker**

Developed a program to track users’ daily leftover and collected user inputs including date, meal, food name, quantity in ounces, leftover reasons, cost, and disposal method to generate reports detailing various leftover reasons based on the user inputs.
* **Tech Stack:** C++
* **Learnings:** Object-oriented programming

**3. CPSC121 - Lab 12**

Practiced applying RAII, destructors, and inherience
* **Tech Stack:** C++
* **Learnings:** RAII, destructors, inherience
